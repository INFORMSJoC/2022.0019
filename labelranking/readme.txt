1. data folder provides two kinds of datasets: semi-synthetic and real-world datasets

2. src folder provides the source code of the label ranking forest (LRF) algorithm

#Both datasets and source code of the Label ranking forest (LRF) algorithm are available at https://github.com/rebelosa/labelrankingforests/.
LRF originally used the Borda count to perform rank aggregation. Here we can replace the Borda count with one heuristic, e.g., ELAHC.
